# ML-Projects
This repository contains my ML projects. It contains a Neural Network that predicts whether a Titanic passenger survived or not, a CNN that classifies images of Simpsons characters and a RNN that predicts Tesla's stock prices. It was made using Python, TensorFlow and Google Colab. This was a project I did for the UoS AI Society.
